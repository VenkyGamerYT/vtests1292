This repository is a clone made from the official Vicidial SVN trunk (revision 3063 as of 2019-02-07). It is meant to be a public Vicidial GIT alternative to the common SVN code the Vicidial group updates.

This version will (mostly) stick to the official source code. However, I might include modifications to some key files which have not been accepted by Matt Florell, but which we find useful for our case uses.

The original source code can be grabbed from svn://svn.eflo.net:3690/agc_2-X/trunk
